This is a quick testing scripts to pull some genes of interest from a small cohort of Asian population with Dry AMD. 
The genes of interest are pulled from researchallofus.org database (A small cohort of 30 patients). 
We are checking the expression of those genes in RPE scRNASeq data 

This is a sort of a quick test, the project will be expanded for a larger cohort of all populations and many other retina diseases.
